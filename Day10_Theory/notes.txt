exception run time error occurs 
jvm is a part of interpreter 
byte code is not an executable file not in windows at least 
thats why you need jvm to execute 
there's a program called bytecode loader .. that is not a part od jvm 
there's another program named bytecode verifier 
and then it passes the byte code to jvm to finally execute it ... jvm will generate the.......
jvm is inside the jre 
.class file converts the source code into byte code
java does not generate any kind of output executable file 
what are we learning today is exception handling 
there are three cases where exception handling is mandatory 
1. file handling 
2. dealing with threads
3. work with database 

try{

}catch( Exception e){


}


!Throw ::
 
 it use the to create the user define exception


from JDK 8, One catch block can handle multiple exception
try catch 



try{

}catch( Exception e){


}finally{
    System.out.print(" HEki ")
}

finally : generally block Define for close all resource
